# Iterative Repair of n-queens Problem: A linear Implementation

The code presented here is largely based off of Rok Sosic and Jun Gu's paper entitled "Efficient Local Search with Conflict Minimization: A Case Study of the N-Queens Problem".  
The task we are attempting to solve is to produce and algorithm that will successfully produce a n-queens solution with as few total boards relative to successful board states as possible.
This work utilized the algorithm described in the aforementioned paper for large n due to the efficiency and exceedingly likely chance that a solution will be found without recreating the board.  
For smaller n values a non-constrained function essentially tries to make each column have no collisions, or 1 collision, or if all else fails place randomly and move on to the next column. Thus allowing
it to recover from local maximums that aren't complete solutions by moving to an objectively worse board state when presented with no other options in hopes of not having to regenerate the board.

## Below is an output from running the program in order to demonstrate it's efficiency and correctness.

## Tools
The cProfile tool was used to determine which functions took the most time (although was quickly abandoned once better tools were found)  
The pprofile tool was used to determine lines in which efficiency could be improved (helped remove random.randint())  
Pycharm was used for development due to it's debugging capabilities and code sense  

## TODO:
This still needs to take file input (should be easy)
Review should be done to verify if the results generated by this are actually correct and valid n-queen boards.
